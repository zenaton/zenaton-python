# Zenaton library for Python

[Zenaton](https://zenaton.com) helps developers to easily run, monitor and orchestrate background jobs on your workers without managing a queuing system. In addition to this, a monitoring dashboard shows you in real-time tasks executions and helps you to handle errors.

The Zenaton library for Python lets you code and launch tasks using Zenaton platform, as well as write workflows as code. You can sign up for an account on [Zenaton](https://zenaton.com) and go through the [tutorial in python](https://app.zenaton.com/tutorial/python).

## Requirements

This package has been tested with Python 3.5.

## Python Documentation

You can find all details on [Zenaton's website](https://zenaton.com/documentation/python/getting-started).

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Install the Zenaton Agent

To install the Zenaton agent, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://install.zenaton.com/ | sh
```

Then, you need your agent to listen to your application.
To do this, you need your **Application ID** and **API Token**.
You can find both on [your Zenaton account](https://app.zenaton.com/api).

```sh
zenaton listen --app_id=YourApplicationId --api_token=YourApiToken --app_env=YourApplicationEnv --boot=boot.py
```

#### Install the library

To add the latest version of the library to your project, run the following command:

```python
pip install zenaton
```

#### Framework integration

If you are using **Django**, please refer to our dedicated documentation to get started:

- [Getting started with Django](https://zenaton.com/documentation/python/agents#django)


### Quick start

#### Client Initialization

To start, you need to initialize the client. To do this, you need your **Application ID** and **API Token**.
You can find both on [your Zenaton account](https://app.zenaton.com/api).

Then, initialize your Zenaton client:

```python

from zenaton.client import Client

Client(your_app_id, your_api_token, your_app_env)
```

#### Executing a background job

A background job in Zenaton is a class implementing the `Zenaton.abstracts.task.Task` interface.

Let's start by implementing a first task printing something, and returning a value:

```python
import random

from zenaton.abstracts.task import Task
from zenaton.traits.zenatonable import Zenatonable

class HelloWorldTask(Task, Zenatonable):

    def handle(self):
        print('Hello World\n')
        return random.randint (0, 1)
```

Now, when you want to run this task as a background job, you need to do the following:

```python
HelloWorldTask().dispatch()
```

That's all you need to get started. With this, you can run many background jobs.
However, the real power of Zenaton is to be able to orchestrate these jobs. The next section will introduce you to job orchestration.

### Orchestrating background jobs

Job orchestration is what allows you to write complex business workflows in a simple way.
You can execute jobs sequentially, in parallel, conditionally based on the result of a previous job,
and you can even use loops to repeat some tasks.

We wrote about some use-cases of job orchestration, you can take a look at [these articles](https://medium.com/zenaton/tagged/python)
to see how people use job orchestration.

#### Using workflows

A workflow in Zenaton is a class implementing the `Zenaton.abstracts.workflow.Workflow` interface.

We will implement a very simple workflow:

First, it will execute the `HelloWorld` task.
The result of the first task will be used to make a condition using an `if` statement.
When the returned value will be greater than `0`, we will execute a second task named `FinalTask`.
Otherwise, we won't do anything else.

One important thing to remember is that your workflow implementation **must** be idempotent.
You can read more about that in our [documentation](https://zenaton.com/documentation/python/workflow-basics/#implementation).

The implementation looks like this:

```python
from tasks.hello_world_task import HelloWorldTask
from tasks.final_task import FinalTask

from zenaton.abstracts.workflow import Workflow
from zenaton.traits.zenatonable import Zenatonable

class MyFirstWorkflow(Workflow, Zenatonable):

    def handle(self):

        n = HelloWorldTask().execute()

        if n > 0:
            FinalTask().execute()
```

Now that your workflow is implemented, you can execute it by calling the `dispatch` method:

```python
MyFirstWorkflow().dispatch()
```

If you really want to run this example, you will need to implement the `FinalTask` task.

There are many more features usable in workflows in order to get the orchestration done right. You can learn more
in our [documentation](https://zenaton.com/documentation/python/workflow-basics/#implementation).
